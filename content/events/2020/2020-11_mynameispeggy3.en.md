"I often ask myself if I am looking for happiness or if happiness is looking for me; but I hide and happiness does not find me".
- Marc Becker

A woman in her prime is nervous. She's going to meet a man. Well, he ran over her dog - but he looked quite nice. But what will he expect from her? What should she be like? Everyday thoughts and yet so difficult - masterfully pointed out by Marc Becker and processed in this tragic-comic monodrama.
