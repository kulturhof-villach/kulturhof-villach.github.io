„Der letzte Raucher“ is a satirical one-person-play set in the here and now. Our main protagonist is equal parts hero and tragic-comical clown. In the course of a party, the smoking outsider is banished onto the prison-linke balcony. Even outside there's a "war" raging: all non-smokers are conspiring against him. He, the last smoker, fights the rest of the world. Locked out, forgotten, lonely and freezing, yet humorous, he lives through a rapid sequence of visions and dreams.
