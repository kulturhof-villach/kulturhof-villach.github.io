We are very happy to have the Austrian band "Man of Isle" here with their first album. Plantig Hearts is a profound story, honest and authentic from the first to the last note of the album.

Founded by singer-songwriter David Edlinger and music producer Stefan Deisenberger, former member of the famos band Naked Lunch. Deisenberger took over the direction of the production and the arrangement of the indie pop work.

In addition to the two authors Edlinger and Deisenberger, guest musicians such as Pieter Gabriel(Sleep Sleep), Ivo Thomann (Cari Cari) and Markus Perner (GARISH) contributed to individual songs on the album.

Planting Hearts, or: the founding of emotions, is an autobiographical work-up as well as an musical exploration of David Edlinger with his childhood and youth spent in a sect, the flight from God and the abolition of naive world-picture painting. The death of his mother suffering from dementia during the production process further influenced the songs and compositions.

So fo a massive substantive substructure is taken care of.  And even if this very personal approach always remains palpable, Planting Hearts is not that difficult at all.  On the contrary, one gives oneself to a strange easiness. When listening to the album you quickly realize that you are on a journey. However, it would be wrong to think that this is a purely musical journey, because Planting Hearts is music that creates images in the mind.

It is a concept album that is packed with bittersweet harmonies that quickly rears up „chorically“, only to come back to their near silent items or form to a driving beat, which invites you to dance. Every sound is appreciated. Here much has space - not least the ability of the listeners to imagine.
