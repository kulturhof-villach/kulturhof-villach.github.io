At Kulturhofkeller, we're establishing a new series of events: Rap in the basement. It is about rap, it is about music, yet it is about so much more: It is about bringing people together and promoting improvisational artforms.
Simply put, it is about slick flows and dope freestyles.

Hosted by „doppelt sichtbar“ und „Freakygreenfish“.
