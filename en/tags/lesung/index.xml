Austrian journalist Franziska Tschinderle (born in Villach) moved to Tirana in Albania for her new book. At this time there was no corona, no travel warnings and open borders. In her texts she writes about the little land at the Adria which was isolated from the rest of the world much too long and now wants to be part of the EU.</description>
